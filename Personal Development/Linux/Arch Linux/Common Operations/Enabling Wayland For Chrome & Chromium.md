# Step No. 01 - Launch Your Prefferred Chrome/Chromium Based Web Browser
---
I am an avid proponent of utilizing applications that do not collect user metadata. One of my favorite browsers in this instance would have to be the thorium browser... 

If you've never heard ofthe throium browser, know that it is a specialized fork of google's chromium browser with even more privacy packed benefits. 

# Step no. 02 - Edit your chrome flags within the browser workspace 

For Google Chrome, Chromium and their based web browsers, e.g., Edge, Vivaldi, just type **chrome://flags/** in address bar and hit Enter.

When the page opens, search for **Preferred Ozone platform** and use the dropdown menu to set it value to “_Wayland_“. Finally, click “Relaunch” button to apply change by restarting the web browser.
