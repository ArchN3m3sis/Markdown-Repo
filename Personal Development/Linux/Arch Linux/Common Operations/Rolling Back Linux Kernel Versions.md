:LiPackageOpen: Arch linux package management can be tricky with the ZFS filesystem. Currently at version 6.7.0 of the arch linux kernel, there is no support for ZFS. 

:LiPackageOpen: To fix this issue, all we need to do is modify some of our configuration files. 

### Editing The Pacman Configuration File
`sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf`

`https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2024/01/15/multilib/os/x86_64/`


To restore all packages to their version at a specific date, let us say 30 March 2014, you have to direct [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman "Pacman") to this date, by editing your `/etc/pacman.conf` and use the following server directive:

[/etc/pacman.conf]
```
##/etc/pacman.conf

[core]
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/{DESIRED-ROLLBACK-DATE}/{REPO-DETAIL}/os/{YOUR-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE}

[extra]
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/{DESIRED-ROLLBACK-DATE}/{REPO-DETAIL}/os/{YOUR-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE}

[community]
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/{DESIRED-ROLLBACK-DATE}/{REPO-DETAIL}/os/{YOUR-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE}
```

_or_ by replacing your `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` with the following content:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

[/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist] :BoBxsFile:
```
##/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
##Arch Linux repository mirrorlist                                             
##Generated on 2042-01-01                                                      

Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/{DESIRED-ROLLBACK-DATE}/$repo/os/$arch
```

Then update the database and force downgrade:

```bash
pacman -Syyuu
```
