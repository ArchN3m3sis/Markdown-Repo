## First Steps When We Have Suffered An Attack 

#### 01) Containing The Incident 
---
This involves isolating the affected hosts or applications...

*This means pulling the machine, the host, the app, the program, OFF OF THE NETWORK!!!

*We really should not stop at disabling device network adapters, we should also unplug the ethernet port as well.*

## Containment 
##### SOAR Tools
---
This is one way that we can automate incident response... 

>[!Question] What does SOAR stand for?

>[!Success] SOAR stands for Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response... 

*SOAR is able to go into our network switches and disable the ports that are connected to the infected host...* 

- [i] The best thing about SOAR is that we can program the system with our own custom tailored ==playbook== that is a set of steps and processes for how our organization prefers to deal with specific types of incident response...

- [i] SOAR will perform all of these functions in an automated fashion, which allows for faster containment of incidents within our environment...  [completion:: 2024-02-05]

### Mitigation 
##### Application Whitelisting / Application Blacklisting 
---
>[!Definition] A Whitelist: is a rule that goes by a list of allowed instances within our network... It is one form of mitigation for our organizations...

>[!Definition] A Blacklist: is a rule that goes by a list of "Denied" instances within our network... It is another form of mitigation for organizations... 

### Quarantine
---
Cisco's Firepower AMP (Advanced Malware Prevention System) comes with a quarantine feature, that allows us to operate in an environment where we can analayze the said intrusion or incident... 

##### Mitigate Through Config Changes 
---
- [i] IOCs (or indicators of compromise) should be used within our existing security products... To do this we need to be vigilent in **updating our configurations** after we have experienced an incident...

### Recovery 
##### Research and Removal 
---


##### Restoration From Backup or Clean OS Installation 
---

##### Back Into Production 
---
This is the end goal in our incident response, to properly contain, mitigate, and recover so that we can get back up and running in our normal production environment...
