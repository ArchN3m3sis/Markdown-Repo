## The First Step To Identifying An Incident 

- One of the most important tools in identifying an incident within any given organization is the proper inspection of reports / logs generated by a *SIEM, which is short for a Security Information & Event Management System*...
- We want to use a methodology for inspection called **Manage By Exception**... 

## What Is A SIEM?
A SIEM is a database driven system that will help us to analyze the data. It will look for *anomolies* and *raise alerts* if it is able to detect anything out of the ordinary...

## Log Files 
*Log files are one of the most effective incident response tools that are built into every machine that we will come into contact with...*

#### The Different Types Of Log Files
---
- Network Logs :FasRightLong: FW, IDS, AP, SIEM
- System Logs :FasRightLong: Linux, MAC, Windows
- Application Logs :FasRightLong: Webmail CRMs EMRs 
- Security Logs :FasRightLong: Logs all events and put them into a text file 
- Web Activity Logs :FasRightLong: Apache Logs, NGINX Logs 
- DNS Logs :FasRightLong: IP-Names, Queries [Tells us who our internal host talks to in the outside world]

**Some Of The Common Things You Will See Within A Log File: 
- [!] Level 
- [!] Date and Time 
- [!] Source 
- [!] Event ID 
- [!] Additional Information Section 


## Syslog 
- [i] Syslog >>> This is a standard for system logging 
	- [*] rsyslog 
	- [*] syslog-ng 
	- [*] nxlog 

The idea behinf all of this is that due to the fact that we have so many logs within any given system, we need to take advantage of a concept called ==Centralized Loggin==

### Log Retention
---
- Logging services that run on a host, will keep data for `x`1 number of days OR for `x` amount of space... 
- This means that your logs have a **finite** lifespan 

*Your log lifespan is an important factor to pay attention to. Most cybersecurity professionals believe that 6 months - 1 year is the best time period for retention of our log files...*
