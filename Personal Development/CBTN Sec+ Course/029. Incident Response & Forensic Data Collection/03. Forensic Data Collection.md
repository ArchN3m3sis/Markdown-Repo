*If there is an incident and forensics are involved, we will probably be dealing with what we refer to as a ==Legal Hold==*

### Legal Holds 
---
>[!Question] What is a legal hold?

>[!Success] A legal hold is ensures that anything related to the incident that occurred is held until 
>	1) The investigation is complete 
>	2) all legal proceedings have taken place 

#### Needed Data Acquisition After An Incident Involving A Legal Hold 
---
- [!] System Images 
- [!] Witness Testimony 
- [!] Pictures 
- [!] Network Logs 
- [!] Video (CCTV) 
- [!] Timestamps & System Offsets 
- [!] File Hashes 
- [!] System Logs 

#### Order Of Volatility 
---
*Some of our evidence will have a definitive lifetime. Meaning that it wont be there forever, so we need to have a prioritized focus on this type of data...* 

**The Order Of Volatility Is As Follows: 
01) Registers / Cache 
02) Routing / Process Tables 
03) Memory (RAM)
04) Removable Media 
05) Logs 
#### Hashing 
---
When we create a hash we use a mathematical algorithm to generate a value (digest) which represents the original data...

- [i] Hashes are a ==FINGERPRINT OF A SPECIFIC SET OF DATA== but they cannot be changed back into the original data... The reason that we want to utilize hashing as a forensic investigation tool is because it allows us to determine whether or not evidence we have gathered was tampered with or not...

##### Creating A Hash Of The Evidence / Data Collection & Evidence Collection Process... 
---
>==Step 01== - Creating The Hash 

>==Step 02== - Making A Copy Of The Original Evidence 
	*We should be utiulizing a `write blocker` to ensure that we only have a read only connection to the copy of evidence.... 

*The above practice helps to provide accountability and data integrity when dealing with the data from an incident...* 

> ==Step 03== - We compare the hashes from our original evidence with the copy we have made... If the hashes match then the image is deemed `UNTAMPERED WITH` and can be submitted as evidence... 

[IF THE HASHES DO NOT MATCH, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT THE DATA IS CONSIDERED TAMPERED WITH AND IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED VIABLE AS ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FROM THE EVENT] 

>==Step 04== - RINSE AND REPEAT...
