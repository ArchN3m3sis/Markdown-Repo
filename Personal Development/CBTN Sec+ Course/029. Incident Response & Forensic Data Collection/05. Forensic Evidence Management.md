### Useful Data Requirements 
---
1) Admissable 
2) Authentic 
3) Complete `We need to provide the entire piece of evidence / no partial logs`
4) Reliable `We should have hashes that we have made during collection of the evidence`
5) Believable `No puzzles or guessing games`


#### Preservation Of Data (Otherwise Known As The Chain Of Custody) 
---
*Much of the information in regard to chain of custody is pertaining to the evidence and it's path from the `COLLECTION` to the `DISPOSAL` of the data* 
1) **Who** had access and **when** did they have it... 
2) **Who Maintains Custody** of the evidence [At ALL TIMES] 
3) **What** work was done on the evidence and **when** was the workk done... 
4) **Storage** Of data and the specifics pertaining to it's storage [WHERE, WHO, WHEN, HOW,] 

>In summary the data's `Chain Of Custody` is the timeline of the evidence from it's collection to it's disposal... 

## E-Discovery

>[!Question] What is E-Recovery?

>[!Success] E-discovery is the process of discovering `electronically stored` data or evidence... 



## Data Recovery 
---
- Data recovery is a common task after a security incident... Most of the times, this happens due to a perpetraitor trying to `cover up` what they did wrong. 
- The idea here is that we need to be well versed in all manners and methods of data recovery to be highly successful as a cybersecurity professional... 

## Non-Repudiation 
>[!Question] What is non-repudiation?

>[!Success] Non-repudiation is a security concept that ensures **two critical qualities**:
>	1. **Origin authenticity:** It guarantees that a specific party, and no other, initiated an action or created a piece of information. This prevents someone from denying being the source of a message, document, or transaction.	
>	2. **Data integrity:** It verifies that the information hasn't been tampered with after its creation. This ensures the recipient receives the exact same content as originally intended.

In simpler terms,==**non-repudiation makes it impossible for someone to deny involvement in something they actually did or to claim changes they didn't make.**==
