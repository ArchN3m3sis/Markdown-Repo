#### Defining Ports With NMAP 
---
```bash
nmap -p 80-500
```
*This command will scan ports 80-500*

```bash
nmap -p 21,34,55
```
*This command will scan the listed ports (comma seperated liist)

```bash
nmap -p-
```
*This will scan all ports*

#### Defining Targets With NMAP 
---
```bash
nmap 10.10.10.5-100
```
*This scans a single target* 

```bash 
nmap 10.10.10.5-100
```
*This scans a range of IP addresses*

```bash
nmap -iL targets.txt
```
*This will scan a list og targets as defined in a file*

##### NMAP Port States 
Nmap is extremely useful in that it will list the state of the open ports we've found within our scanned targets. There are three primary states that NMAP will reveal to us... 
01) Open 
02) Closed 
03) Filtered 

*What does the `filtered` port state indicate?*

> Whenever you come across a filtered port state inside of Nmap, this is an indicator that there is a firewall running on that port... This means that it will not communicate with us, but that it will talk with another potential machine on the network...
