**Ownership** inside of linux is actually quite ingenious. In fact, it's not just ownership but the entire permissions system... 

Linux Files have a very set structure. On every file you display [this can be done with the ls commmand] you will see three different sets of permissions...

The first group represents the owner permissions of a file 
The second group represents the group permissions of a file 
The third group represents "others" permissions of a file 

For Example: 
*If you were to see a file with the following: -r-- r-- --- // it would signify a linux file that had an owner with read permissions a group with read permission, and explicitly denies read, write, and execute permissions for all other users who try to access the file...* 

When Referring To The Groups The Following Is True 
	`u = owner  G=Group   o=others`

```bash
chmod u+wx <filename>
```
*This command would add write and execute priveledges to the owner of the specified file* 


### The Most Common Implemented Shell For Remote Access 
---
#### SSH 


### Other Well Known Shells

#### PowerShell 

#### Python 



## Other Commonly Used And Useful Commands 

```bash
touch <filename>
```
*This command allows us to create a new file*

```bash
ls 
```
*The list command proves to be extremely useful with the linux environent*

#### The `Logger` Command
