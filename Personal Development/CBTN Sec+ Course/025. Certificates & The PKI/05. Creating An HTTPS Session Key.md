- [i] To use `https` we will absolutely be using assymetric encryption to initially set up the secure connection. This is because they will need keypairs to decrypt and encrypt the data, and to verify signatures... 

- [i] Once the server/client have established this connection, we will be using symmetrical encryption... 

- [i] This means that for one phase of the communication session, the user and the server will need different keys (One Has Public Key and One Has Private Key), but they will also need the same key to access the encrypted content once the session is established...
