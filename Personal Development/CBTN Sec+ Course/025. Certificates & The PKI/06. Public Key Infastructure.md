>[!Question] Wht is the Public Key Infastructure?
>Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the entire system that enables secure communication and digital trust online. It's like a complex security blanket you might not even notice, but it protects you in multiple ways. Here's the breakdown:

**Imagine PKI as a ==three-part team==:**

**1. The Tools:**
- **Public and private key pairs:** These are special mathematical codes linked together. You keep your private key secret, while the public key is shared openly. Think of it like a lock and key: anyone can use the public key to "lock" a message, but only you have the private key to "unlock" it.
- **Digital certificates:** These are like electronic passports, issued by trusted authorities (called Certificate Authorities or CAs), that link your public key to your identity (e.g., your website, email address, or company).

**2. The Process:**
- **Creating and managing keys:** PKI helps generate, store, and distribute these keys securely.
- **Issuing and verifying certificates:** CAs within the PKI system verify your identity and issue certificates, ensuring they're legitimate and trustworthy.
- **Encrypting and signing data:** PKI facilitates secure communication by using public keys to encrypt data you send (making it unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient) and private keys to sign data (verifying it came from you and hasn't been tampered with).

**3. The Benefits:**
- **Confidentiality:** PKI encrypts data, ensuring only authorized parties can access it.
- **Authentication:** Digital signatures and certificates verify identities and prevent impersonation.
- **Integrity:** PKI helps detect any changes made to data, ensuring its trustworthiness.

### Where is PKI used?
PKI is essential for various online activities like:

- **Secure websites (HTTPS):** The padlock symbol you see in your browser address bar indicates a website using PKI for secure communication.
- **Email signing and encryption:** PKI can digitally sign and encrypt emails for secure communication.
- **Online transactions:** PKI secures e-commerce and online banking by protecting sensitive information.
- **Software signing:** PKI verifies the authenticity and integrity of software downloads.

So, PKI is like the unseen guardian of online security, working behind the scenes to keep your information safe and ensure trust in your digital interactions.


#### Revoked Certificates 
- Sometime certificates are revoked... So how would a client know whether or not a certificate has been revoked?

*There are a couple of options for this...*

==The Oldschool Method== would be using something called a *Certificate Revocation List*... 

*If the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) is the route you want to go you would have to download and maintain an updated list and every time you wanted to download any resource, you would cross examine the CRL with the current digital certificate from the owner of the resource you are trying to receive... 

==The newer and better option== would be using what we refer to as *OSCP* or the *Online Certificate Status Protocol*... This is accesible online and will determine whether or not a digital certificate has been revoked or not... 

`There exists many internal certificates of authority as well, but know that if using an internal certificate authority, that your browsers within your infastructure will have to be trained to trust that authority...`

>[!Question] What is a CSR?
>[!Success] A CSR stands for a certificate setting request... A certificate signing request (CSR) is essentially your **application form for a digital certificate**. It's like getting a passport for your website or online identity.

### What Do CSRs Contain?
**What it contains:**

- **Information about you or your organization:** This helps the Certificate Authority (CA) verify your identity and issue a certificate specific to you.
- **Your public key:** This is a long, complex code used for encryption and verification. Think of it as your "open door" key for secure communication.
- **A digital signature:** This proves you have control over the private key (the matching "lock" key) associated with your public key.

### Where are CSRs used?
**Where it's used:**

- **Obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate:** This secures your website and protects user data during communication.
- **Getting code signing certificates:** These verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded software.
- **Acquiring email signing certificates:** These digitally sign your emails for authenticity and encryption.

### How do CSRs work?
**How it works:**

1. You generate a CSR on your server or device.
2. You submit the CSR to a trusted CA.
3. The CA verifies your identity and validates the CSR information.
4. If everything is valid, the CA issues you a digital certificate containing your public key and information, digitally signed by them.
5. You install the certificate on your server or device, enabling secure communication or verification based on its purpose.

**Remember:**

- You never share your private key with anyone, not even the CA.
- Different types of certificates require different information in the CSR.
- Generating a CSR is usually quite technical, but many service providers and software applications can assist you.

*Example of generating a CSR*

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ogit.comm.key -out ogit.com.csr
