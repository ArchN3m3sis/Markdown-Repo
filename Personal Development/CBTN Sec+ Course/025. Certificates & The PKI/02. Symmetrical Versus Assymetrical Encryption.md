- [i] A big distinction we need to make as we get into cybersecurity is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption... 

### Asymmetric VS, Symmetric Encryption
- Think of a lock that one user locks with a specific and unique key... 
- They can then send that key to another user, and the only way for the other user to unlock it is to have the exact copy of the key that the sending user used to lock the data...

>[!Question] What Is Symmetric Encryption?
>Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same **secret key** is used for both encrypting and decrypting data. Imagine it like a lock with a single key: anyone with the key can both lock and unlock the information... 

==Heres How Symmetric Encryption Works: ==
1) **The sender** uses the shared secret key to scramble the original data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext).
2) **The receiver**, who also possesses the same secret key, uses the key to unscramble the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.
### Advantages & Disadvantages Of Symmetric Encryption 
==**Advantages of symmetric encryption:**==
- **Fast and efficient:** Due to its simple design, it's faster than other encryption methods, making it suitable for large data volumes.
- **Low resource consumption:** Requires less computational power compared to other methods, ideal for devices with limited resources.
- **Widely used:** Used in various applications like secure communication channels, data storage, and file encryption.
==**Disadvantages of symmetric encryption:**==
- **Key management challenge:** Securely sharing and storing the secret key is crucial, as compromising the key exposes all encrypted data.
- **Not suitable for large-scale access:** Sharing the key with multiple recipients increases the risk of compromise.
- **Vulnerable to "man-in-the-middle" attacks:** If an attacker intercepts the communication and obtains the key, they can decrypt and alter data undetected.

### Examples Of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms: 
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Widely used for *government and commercial applications.*
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** Older algorithm, still used in some *legacy systems.*
- **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4):** Used in *early wireless protocols*, considered *less secure nowadays.*

**Remember:** While symmetric encryption offers speed and efficiency, its key management challenges make it less suitable for scenarios with many users or where absolute secrecy is paramount. For such cases, asymmetric encryption, which uses different keys for encryption and decryption, might be a better choice.

>[!Question] What is asymmetric encryption?
>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a type of encryption that uses **two mathematically linked keys** for encrypting and decrypting data. Unlike symmetric encryption where a single key is used for both tasks, here each key has a specific purpose:

#### Purposes Of Asymmetric Keys: 
- **Public Keys** are *freely available* and can be shared with anyone. It's used to encrypt data...
- **Private Keys** only the *mailbox owner (with the private key)* can retrieve messages (or decrypt data) put in this slot... 

### How Does Asymmetric Encryption Work?
1. **The sender** obtains the recipient's **public key** (which is publicly available).
2. **The sender uses the public key to encrypt** their message, transforming it into an unreadable format.
3. **Only the recipient**, who possesses the corresponding **private key**, can **decrypt** the message using their **private key**.

### Advantages & Disadvantages To Asymmetric Encryption 
**Disadvantages of asymmetric encryption:**
- **Slower than symmetric encryption:** Requires more complex mathematical operations, making it slower than symmetric encryption for large data volumes.
- **Not ideal for bulk encryption:** More computationally expensive compared to symmetric encryption, making it less suitable for encrypting large datasets.
- **Key management still important:** Protecting the private key remains crucial, as its compromise can expose all encrypted data.

### Examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms:
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman):** Widely used for secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):** Offers smaller key sizes for the same level of security compared to RSA, making it useful for resource-constrained devices.

>[!Remember] 
>While asymmetric encryption *offers increased security due to separate keys*, it may not be the best choice for *encrypting large amounts of data due to its computational cost*. Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on your specific needs and security requirements.

### Encryption/Decryption Assignment With Assymetric Encryption 
- While the primary use of private keys is for decryption, they _can_ technically be used for encryption in certain scenarios. However, *it's important to note that this is not the typical or recommended approach in most asymmetric encryption systems.*

**Here's a more detailed explanation:**
- **Typical Usage:**
    - [!]  Public key for encryption
    - [!]  Private key for decryption
    
- **Possible Private Key Encryption:**
    - [b]  While mathematically possible, it's not the standard practice.
    - [b]  It raises security concerns as the private key, meant to be secret, would be used for encryption, potentially exposing it to interception.

**Scenarios where private key encryption might be used:**
1. **Digital Signatures:**
    - [>]  To create a digital signature, the sender encrypts a hash of the message with their _private key_.
    - [>] This proves the sender's identity and the message's integrity, as only the owner of the private key could have created the signature.
2. **Hybrid Encryption:**
    - [>] In some cases, asymmetric encryption is combined with symmetric encryption for efficiency.
    - [>] The sender might encrypt a large message with a symmetric key and then encrypt that symmetric key with the recipient's public key.
    - [>] The recipient can then use their private key to decrypt the symmetric key and subsequently decrypt the message.

**Key Considerations:**
- Private key encryption is *less common and requires careful consideration of security implications*.
- The primary purpose of private keys remains decryption and authentication.
- Using public keys for encryption is generally preferred for secure communication.

**Conclusion:**
While technically possible, private key encryption is not the standard practice in asymmetric encryption due to security concerns. It's essential to understand the primary roles of public and private keys and the specific scenarios where private key encryption might be employed.

## Using OpenSSL For A Password Protected Encryption 
*Command Line Example*
In this example we will be using a lnux utility tool called `openssl`... If you need some guidance, you can simply enter the following command to see some of your help options... 

```bash
openssl help
```

**or**

```bash 
man openssl 
```

**Here's how to encrypt a file with OpenSSL ==using a password:==**

**1. Generate a strong password:**
- Use a password generator or create a long, complex password that's difficult to guess.

**2. Encrypt the file:**
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Use the following command:

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in original_file.txt -out encrypted_file.enc
```

- Replace `original_file.txt` with the actual filename of the file you want to encrypt.
- Replace `encrypted_file.enc` with the desired filename for the encrypted file.
- You'll be prompted to enter and confirm the password.

**3. Decrypt the file:**

- Use this command:

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted_file.enc -out decrypted_file.txt
```

- Enter the correct password when prompted.

==**Key points:**==
- `enc`: Specifies encryption or decryption mode.
- `-aes-256-cbc`: Uses the AES-256 cipher in CBC mode for strong encryption.
- `-salt`: Adds a random salt to enhance security.
- `-in`: Specifies the input file.
- `-out`: Specifies the output file.
- `-d`: Decryption mode.

==**Additional considerations:**==
- **Key derivation function (KDF):** For better security, consider using a stronger KDF like PBKDF2:
    
```bash
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -salt -in original_file.txt -out encrypted_file.enc
```

- **Large files:** For large files, encrypting with symmetric encryption first (e.g., AES) and then encrypting the symmetric key with asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) can be more efficient.
    
- **Secure key management:** Store passwords and keys securely using password managers or dedicated key management solutions.

### Using OpenSSL For Asymmetric Encryption 
==**Here's how to encrypt a file with an asymmetric key pair using OpenSSL:**==
**1. Generate a key pair (if you don't have one):**
- Use the following command:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
```
- This creates a 2048-bit RSA private key and saves it as `private_key.pem`.
- Extract the public key:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```

**2. Encrypt the file with the recipient's public key:**
- Use this command:

```bash
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public_key.pem -in original_file.txt -out encrypted_file.enc
```

- Replace `original_file.txt` with the actual filename of the file you want to encrypt.
- Replace `encrypted_file.enc` with the desired filename for the encrypted file.

**3. Decrypt the file with the recipient's private key:**
- Use this command:

```bash
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in encrypted_file.enc -out decrypted_file.txt
```

**Key points:**
- `rsautl`: Utility for RSA encryption/decryption.
- `-encrypt`: Encryption mode.
- `-pubin`: Specifies that the input key is a public key.
- `-inkey`: Specifies the input key file.
- `-decrypt`: Decryption mode.

**Additional considerations:**
- **Key management:** Securely store and distribute public keys. Protect private keys with passwords or hardware security modules (HSMs).
- **Hybrid encryption:** For large files, consider hybrid encryption:
    - Encrypt the file with a symmetric cipher (e.g., AES) and a randomly generated key.
    - Encrypt the symmetric key with the recipient's public key.
    - This combines the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the key management benefits of asymmetric encryption.
- **Padding:** Use appropriate padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#1) for security and compatibility.
- **File integrity:** Consider using digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of the encrypted file.
