>[!Question] What is Stapling?
---
>[!Answer] - In the context of network security, "stapling" refers to the process of **attaching a digital signature to an SSL/TLS certificate**. This signature is issued by a trusted third party (Certificate Authority) and verifies the authenticity and integrity of the certificate. Stapling can help to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and improve the overall security of online communication.

>[!Question] What is certificate pinning?
---
>[!Answer] Certificate pinning is a security mechanism used in online applications to mitigate the risk of **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**. It works by "pinning" or pre-configuring within the application the expected public key or certificate fingerprint of the trusted server it should connect to. This way, *the application only accepts connections from that specific server and rejects any connection attempts using different certificates*, even if they are valid and signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

>Pinning can be thought of as an expectation set by the user computer to see very specific certain criteria for pre determined connections.
