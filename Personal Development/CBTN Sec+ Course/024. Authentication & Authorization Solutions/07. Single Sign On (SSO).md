## Single Sign On (SSO) 
The more passwords that an individual user has to work with, the more likely it is that the user makes an error when inputting passwords. 

- [i] The most popular way for organizations to use single sign on is via a Microsoft Product.., This is the **Active Directory & Kerberos**... 

>[!Question] What Is Kerberos?
>  Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. Developed by MIT in the 1980s, it's now a widely used standard for authentication in enterprise environments, particularly Microsoft Windows domains.

### How Does Kerberos Work?
*Here's how Kerberos works:*

1. **The user enters their credentials** (username and password) on a client device.
2. **The client contacts the Authentication Server (AS)**, which is a ==trusted third-party server in the network==.
3. **The AS verifies the user's credentials** and, if successful, generates ==two temporary tickets==:
    - **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT):** This ticket contains an encrypted copy of the user's secret key and is ==used to obtain other tickets==.
    - **Session Ticket:** This ticket ==encrypts the user's identity and is used to access specific services on the network==.
    
4. **The client receives the TGT and the session ticket** and stores them securely.
5. **The client contacts the Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**, presenting the TGT and requesting a session ticket for a specific service.
6. **The TGS verifies the TGT and, if valid, issues a session ticket** for the requested service.
7. **The client presents the session ticket to the service** it wants to access.
8. **The service verifies the session ticket and, if valid, grants the client access.**

*Kerberos offers ==several advantages== over other authentication methods, such as:*
- **Strong security:** Kerberos uses encryption to protect tickets and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Single sign-on (SSO):** Users only need to enter their credentials once to access multiple services on the network.
- **Scalability:** Kerberos can be used in large networks with many users and services.
- **Flexibility:** Kerberos can be integrated with other security systems, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

*However, Kerberos also has some ==limitations==, such as:*
- **Complexity:** Kerberos can be complex to set up and manage.
- **Limited interoperability:** Kerberos ==is not always compatible with non-Windows systems.==
- **Vulnerability to certain attacks:** Kerberos is ==vulnerable to attacks that target the KDC or steal tickets.==

> [!Question] What Is The Principal/Subject as it pertains to Authentication & Authorization
> **Subject:** Imagine it as ==the "who" trying to access something==. It can be a user, an application, or even a device.
**Principal:** Think of it as ==the "what==" that ==identifies the subject==. It's like a fingerprint or ID card specific to that subject.

Here's how they fit in:

- **Authentication:**
    - [I]  The subject (e.g., user) presents their credentials (e.g., username/password).
    - [I]  The system verifies the credentials and assigns a principal (e.g., unique user ID) if successful.
- **Authorization:**
    - [I]  The subject (identified by the principal) requests access to a resource.
    - [I]  The system checks if the principal has the necessary permissions for that resource based on pre-defined rules.

**Example:** User John (subject) logs in with his password (credentials). If valid, the system assigns him the principal "John123". When John tries to edit a document, the system checks if "John123" has "edit" permission for that document.

**Key points:**
- One subject *can have multiple principals (roles, IDs).*
- Principals are *used for access control decisions*, not authentication itself.
- Understanding this distinction *helps clarify security processes*.

> [!Question] What is an IDP?
> An IDP stands for ==**Identity Provider (IdP)**== and plays a crucial role in *authentication and authorization*, managing the "who" aspect that you mentioned earlier. Here's what it does:

**Think of it as a secure digital gatekeeper.**
- **Stores and manages user identities:** The IdP holds information about users, like usernames, passwords, and other attributes.
- **Verifies user credentials:** When a user tries to access something (website, app, etc.), the IdP *checks if their credentials (username/password, etc.) are correct and valid*.
- **Provides authentication tokens:** If successful, the *IdP issues a "token"* (like a temporary pass) that confirms the user's identity.
- **Doesn't directly grant access:** The IdP ==doesn't decide who gets access to what==. It just *verifies the user's identity*.

>[!Question] What is SAML?
>SAML, which stands for **Security Assertion Markup Language**, is an open standard that facilitates secure communication between two parties involved in user authentication and authorization 

##### The 2 Parties Being Referred To Are: 
	1) Identity Provider: The trusted entity that verifies the user credentials and   provides user information... 
	2) Service Provider: The application or resource a user wants to access (e.g. a website or app)...

## How Does SAML Work?
Here's how SAML works:
1. **User attempts to access an SP:** When you try to log in to a website or app, the SP redirects you to the IdP you trust (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
2. **IdP authenticates the user:** You enter your credentials on the IdP's login page. If successful, the IdP verifies your identity.
3. **IdP sends assertion to SP:** Instead of giving you direct access, the IdP creates a secure document called an "assertion" containing your identity information and permissions.
4. **SP receives and verifies assertion:** The SP receives the assertion from the IdP and uses its security keys to verify it.
5. **SP grants access (if valid):** If the assertion is valid, the SP grants you access to the requested resource without needing you to log in again.


==**Benefits of using SAML:**==
- **Single sign-on (SSO):** You only need to log in once to access multiple SPs that use the same IdP.
- **Improved security:** Strong authentication methods and secure communication between IdP and SP enhance overall security.
- **Centralized identity management:** Easier to manage user identities and access controls through a single IdP.
- **Flexibility:** Works with various IdPs and SPs, increasing vendor choices.

==**Common use cases:**==
- Enterprise applications (e.g., Salesforce, Office 365)
- Social logins (e.g., logging in to websites with Google or Facebook)
- Government and healthcare portals

**Remember:** SAML doesn't directly handle authorization (deciding who gets access). That's often done by separate systems based on the information provided in the SAML assertion.
