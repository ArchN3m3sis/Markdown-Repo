- If we are enforcing the use of individual user accounts, we will need to be in the know on how we manage all of the users and permissions that will vary from individual to individual... To do this, many organizations take advantage of a tool called **Active Directory**...

>[!Question] What is Active Directory?
> Active Directory (AD) is a directory service created by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems and enables administrators to manage permissions and access to networked resources.

### The Function Of Active Directory Within An Organization...
Active Directory *organizes an organization's users, computers, and other network devices into a hierarchical structure*, allowing administrators to *manage these entities in a centralized, structured, and secure manner*. Active Directory is also **integrated with an assortment of Windows server technologies and gives the ability to centrally manage and sync user information for all network users**.

- [i] The main services provided by Active Directory include:
	1. **Domain Services (AD DS)**: These are the core functions of Active Directory, including the directory store, which allows for management of user accounts and device registrations.
	2. **Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**: This is a lighter version of AD DS and does not require domains or domain controllers.
	3. **Certificate Services (AD CS)**: This creates, distributes, and manages secure certificates.
	4. **Rights Management (AD RMS)**: This controls access to rights-protected content.
	5. **Federation Services (AD FS)**: This provides a single sign-on service to affiliate with trusted external (partner) entities or to enable inter-organizational relationships.

Using Active Directory can greatly simplify network management and growth, enhance security and ensure consistency, and improve efficiency and productivity for network administrators.

### Effective Practices When Administrating User Accounts With Active Directory...
**Application Of Priveledge Through Groups**
- [p] When giving a user permissions, try to apply those permissions through ==**Groups**== instead of applying specific user permission to the individual... This will help to prevent ==CREEP== or ==Priveledge CREEP== for any given user within the organization... 
**Routine Audits**
- [p] Audits should identitfy what user accounts we have, what groups they are in, and what the priveledge level of the groups are. This should occur every time there is a job change within the organization... [This is the #1 area where we see CREEP happen] 

>[!Question] What is CREEP?
>Privilege Creep refers to the *gradual accumulation of access rights beyond what an individual needs to perform their job*. It typically happens *when an employee's job functions change*, or they are *promoted or transferred*, and new privileges are added ==without removing the old ones==. Over time, this leads to users having more privileges than they need, *potentially creating security risks.*

### Managing Priveledge Creep...
*To manage Privilege Creep, organizations often employ several strategies:*
1. **Regular Audits**: Review user privileges regularly and revoke unnecessary access. This can be a part of a regular access certification process.
2. **Role-based Access Control**: Define user roles carefully based on job function and assign access rights based on these roles. When an employee's role changes, the previous role (and its associated privileges) is revoked, and the new one is assigned, ensuring they only have the access necessary to perform their new job.
3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant only the permissions that are necessary for a user to perform their job and no more.
4. **Use Automated Solutions**: Tools can automate the process of enforcing the principle of least privilege and other security policies, making the process more efficient and less susceptible to errors.

- [!] By enforcing least privilege and conducting regular reviews, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of Privilege Creep.

### Crucial Points For Routine Audits...
As an administrator in an IT company, conducting routine audits is important to ensure compliance, strengthen security, and maintain the optimal functioning of the systems. The timing of audits can vary depending on the business requirements, regulatory landscape, and the specific types of audits being conducted. Here are some common scenarios when routine audits are typically performed:

1. **Scheduled Regular Intervals**: Routine audits are often conducted at regular intervals, which could be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually. The frequency depends on the companyâ€™s policy, the sensitivity of the data, and the regulatory obligations.
2. **Post System Changes or Updates**: After major changes to the IT infrastructure like a system update, addition or removal of hardware, or a significant software update, an audit should be performed to ensure the changes haven't negatively impacted security or system functionality.
3. **Policy Changes**: An audit should be conducted if there are significant changes to company policies related to IT, for example, data handling, safety protocol, cybersecurity, or user access regulations.
4. **Incident Response**: If a security incident (like a data breach or cyberattack) has occurred, it's crucial to conduct an audit to understand what went wrong, assess the impact, and identify steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
5. **Compliance**: To meet regulatory requirements, audits must be performed periodically. The timeline can be dictated by the governing regulatory framework like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOX, or PCI DSS.
6. **Prior to Audits by External Agencies**: Conducting an internal audit before an external audit can help the organization prepare and ensure compliance.
7. **Employee Turnover**: When a staff member leaves, especially if they had high-level access to systems and data, an audit should be completed to secure the systems and ensure unauthorized access points are closed.

- [i] It's always important to document all audits, including what was checked, results, remediation implemented, and future actions to be taken. This documentation can be invaluable during future audits or in the event of security incidents.
