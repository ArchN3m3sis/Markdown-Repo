>[!Danger] Shared Accounts Are The Cardinal Sin In Any IT Infastructure
>It is so crucially important to set up your infastructure so that the users within your organization are not able to all share one password to access any given resource or account... When shared accounts are used, we lose all accountabilit, dilute the effectiveness of logging, and open up many different types of security risk... 

- One way of doing this is to setup your routers to only accept secure methods of connectivity...
- You can also set up `local only` access to the specified resource... 
- The wide scope principal is that we should be able to see what user is logging into what resource...

>[!Question] Which of the following should be done to improve accountability and auditing?
>	[a] Only use TACACS+
>	[b] Use a WORM drive for accounting records
>	[c] Don't use shared accounts
>	[d] Only use RADIUS
>	[e] Save `read only` copies of accounting logs

### Common Ways To Improve Our Organizations Accounbtability & Auditing...
>[!Question] What is a AAA Server?
>A AAA server is a server program that handles all three of the core IT security functions, which are authentication, authorization, and accounting... This server is typically used in networks for access management.

- [?] How does a AAA Server perform each of the specified functions within a given environment?
	- - **Authentication** ➡ It identifies users by checking their credentials (usernames, passwords, OTPs, etc.). In this way, it ensures the user is who they say they are.
	- - **Authorization** ➡ Once users are authenticated, this process determines what users are allowed to do on a system or network. For example, it may determine what files users can access or what commands they can execute.
	- - **Accountability** ➡ This process records what users do on a system or network. For example, it may log when users log in and out, what actions they take, and how much bandwidth they use. This data can be useful for billing, auditing, and troubleshooting.
- [?] What are 2 of the most common protocols used by AAA Servers?
	1) RADIUS
	2) TACACS+

>[!Question] What Is TACACS+?
>TACACS+ stands for Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus. It's a protocol that was developed by Cisco and released as an open standard beginning in 1993. TACACS+ is commonly used for network security and, like RADIUS, used for AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting), but it separates these functions for more flexibility and security.

### Further Details On TACACS+...
- [i] Just for a refresher, the functions that the TACACS+ handles in **SEPERATE** fashion are: 
1. Authentication: It verifies the user's identity.
2. Authorization: It checks the services the user has access to.
3. Accounting: It logs the activities of the user.

- [!] *In TACACS+, each function can be segregated and handled on a separate server if desired, whereas in RADIUS, these three functions, while distinguishable, are inseparably linked.*
- [!] TACACS+ uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is considered more reliable than the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) used by RADIUS. It is primarily used in networks managed by companies that use a lot of Cisco devices, although it's not restricted to just Cisco hardware.

>[!Question] What Is RADIUS?
>RADIUS stands for ==Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service==. RADIUS is a **networking protocol** that *provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service*.

### Further Detail On RADIUS...
- [i] Here is a biot more detail on the three security functions carried out by **RADIUS**
1. **Authentication**: RADIUS *verifies the identity of users attempting to connect to the network*. The most common method is using a ==username and password==, but it can also use other methods like ==token-based systems==.
2. **Authorization**: This process *grants access to network resources based on the user’s privileges*. For example, it controls which parts of the network the user can access and what actions they're authorized to do.
3. **Accounting**: This *keeps track of users' network usage data*. This could include the amount of time spent on the network, services accessed, bytes transferred, etc. These records can be used for trend analysis, capacity planning, billing, auditing, and cost analysis.

- [i] RADIUS provides these services using a client-server model where *the RADIUS server is responsible for the AAA management and the RADIUS client (usually a ==network access server==) communicates with the server on behalf of the user*.
- [!] It's important to note that RADIUS transmits data using ==UDP (User Datagram Protocol)==, which is *less reliable than TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) used by alternatives like TACACS+*.

### Options For Honing In On Accountability & Auditing Security...
*There are hundreds of ways that we are able to improve our auditing and accountability standards within an IT organization. The following are just a couple of ideas as you get started down your IT career path...*

- [i] Organizations can make use of special types of drives, which make it very hard for data to be erased... These are what we call `worm drives`...

>[!Question] What is a WORM drive?
>WORM stands for "Write Once, Read Many". It's a data storage technology that allows a piece of data to be written onto a device only once and read many times, but prevents the data from being erased or modified.

#### Common Use Cases For WORM Drives...
- [l] ==WORM storage== is used for information that *must not be altered or deleted after it has been written*, such as *medical records, financial records, and legal documents*. This unalterable nature of the WORM storage media can help meet compliance regulations, archiving requirements, and digital record keeping standards.
#### History Of WORM Drives...
- [b] Originally WORM technology was introduced in *optical storage media like CD-R and DVD-R*. Later, *tape-based WORM media was introduced for enterprise backup, archiving solutions, and digital data preservation*. Today, it also applies to *certain types of flash-based and hard drives*.

So, a WORM drive in this context would be a ==storage device where data, once written, cannot be changed or erased, delivering a high level of data security by protecting archived records or files from alteration or deletion==.

### CISCO Specific Implementation Of AAA Server...
>[!Question] What is CISCO's Proprietary AAA Server?
>- Cisco's proprietary AAA server is called the Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS), which leverages protocols such as RADIUS (Remote Access Dial-In User Service) and TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus).

- Cisco ACS provides a centralized identity networking solution and simplified user access management across all network resources. It supports the enforcement of access policies, auditing of activities, and reporting services to ensure compliance with various industry regulations.
### The Migration To ISE (Pronounced ICE)...
- *As of August 2017, Cisco announced the end of life and end of support for Cisco Secure ACS, recommending migration to their latest product called Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). ISE provides these same AAA services but also includes context-aware access control policies, more thorough posturing services, and guest access management among other functionalities.*
