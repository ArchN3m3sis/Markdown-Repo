- [i] There are 3 primary types of controls within the world of cybersecurity, and they are as follows:
	1) Physical Controls
	2) Managerial/Administrative Controls
	3) Technical Controls

### Physical Control Overview 
---
>Physical controls act as the first line of defense in cybersecurity, creating a tangible barrier between malicious actors and your sensitive data and systems. They work alongside technical and administrative controls to form a comprehensive security strategy. Here's a brief overview:

>[!Question] What are physical controls?
>	Physical controls are measures taken in the real world to protect physical assets like servers, devices, and data storage. They create a perimeter security around your IT infrastructure, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access and potentially cause harm.

##### Examples Of Physical Controls
---
- **Access control:** Fences, security gates, keycards, biometric scanners (fingerprint, iris), mantrap doors, security guards patroling restricted areas.
- **Surveillance:** Security cameras, motion sensors, intrusion detection systems, perimeter alarms.
- **Environmental controls:** Temperature and humidity regulation in data centers to prevent equipment damage, fire suppression systems.
- **Secure disposal:** Shredding confidential documents, secure recycling of electronic devices.

##### The Importance Of Physical Controls 
---
- [?] **Why are they important?**
- **Prevent direct attacks:** They stop intruders from physically accessing and tampering with hardware or stealing data storage devices.
- **Protect against social engineering:** Reduce the risk of someone tricking employees into granting unauthorized access.
- **Complement technical controls:** Work in tandem with firewalls, encryption, and other software-based security measures for a layered defense.
- **Deter and detect:** Visible security measures can deter potential attackers and help detect suspicious activity.

##### Physical Control Summary 
---
**Remember:**
- Physical controls are only one part of a complete cybersecurity strategy.
- Their effectiveness depends on proper implementation, maintenance, and regular updates.
- The specific controls needed will vary depending on your organization's size, industry, and risk profile.
### Administrative / Managerial Control Overview 
>[!Question] What are administrative/managerial controls?
>	In cybersecurity, managerial controls are the **high-level policies, procedures, and processes** that guide an organization's overall security posture. They act like the **roadmap and steering wheel** of your cybersecurity efforts, shaping how other controls like technical and physical measures are implemented and used.

##### What Do Managerial Controls Do?
---
- **Define security goals and objectives:** They outline what the organization wants to achieve in terms of security, like protecting specific data or mitigating certain risks.
- **Establish roles and responsibilities:** They clarify who is accountable for different aspects of cybersecurity, ensuring everyone knows their part.
- **Set security policies and procedures:** They define acceptable behavior and specific actions for various situations, like password best practices or incident response procedures.
- **Promote security awareness and training:** They ensure employees are educated about cybersecurity risks and how to stay safe online.
- **Guide risk management:** They establish processes for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks.
- **Ensure compliance with regulations:** They align with relevant industry standards and legal requirements.

##### Examples Of Managerial Controls 
---
- **Security policy:** Defines acceptable use of IT resources, password requirements, and data classification.
- **Incident response plan:** Outlines steps to take in case of a security breach.
- **Business continuity plan:** Ensures critical operations continue even if a cyberattack disrupts systems.
- **Disaster recovery plan:** Helps restore systems and data after a major incident.
- **Access control policy:** Specifies who can access what systems and data.

##### Benefits Of Using Managerial Controls 
---
- **Proactive approach:** Addresses security holistically instead of reacting to incidents.
- **Efficient resource allocation:** Ensures resources are directed towards the most critical areas.
- **Improved accountability:** Ensures everyone is responsible for upholding security standards.
- **Standardized practices:** Creates consistency in how security is managed across the organization.
- **Compliance and legal readiness:** Helps meet regulatory requirements and mitigate legal risks.

##### Summary Of Managerial Controls 
---
- Managerial controls are essential for establishing a strong foundation for cybersecurity, but they need to be translated into actionable technical and physical controls for true effectiveness.
- These controls should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving threats and business needs.
- Successful implementation requires buy-in and active participation from all levels of the organization.

### Technical Controls 
---
>[!Question] What are technical controls?
>	Technical controls are the **nuts and bolts** of your cybersecurity arsenal. They are hardware and software tools and mechanisms that **directly defend your systems and data against cyberattacks**. Think of them as the firewalls, alarms, and security guards of the digital world.

##### What do technical controls do?
---
- **Prevent unauthorized access:** Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), access control lists (ACLs), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) all work to keep out intruders.
- **Protect confidentiality:** Encryption safeguards sensitive data at rest and in transit, making it unreadable if intercepted.
- **Ensure data integrity:** Data integrity checks and digital signatures prevent unauthorized modifications to data.
- **Detect and respond to threats:** Antivirus software, malware scanners, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems identify and alert you to suspicious activity.
- **Control system functionality:** Patch management, software restrictions, and application whitelisting limit potential vulnerabilities and harmful actions.


##### Examples of technical controls: 
---
- **Software:** Firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, encryption software, data loss prevention (DLP) tools, vulnerability scanners, patch management tools.
- **Hardware:** Security tokens, smart cards, biometric authenticators, secure hardware modules (HSMs) for storing encryption keys.

##### Benefits of technical controls 
---
- **Automated protection:** Provide continuous and consistent defense against various threats.
- **Granular control:** Can be tailored to specific security needs and risk profiles.
- **Scalability:** Can be easily adapted to growing networks and changing threats.
- **Visibility and monitoring:** Offer insights into system activity and potential security issues.

##### Summary Of Technical Controls 
---
- Technical controls are essential, but not enough on their own. They need to be combined with strong physical and managerial controls for comprehensive security.
- Different controls address different risks and vulnerabilities. Choosing the right mix is crucial.
- Effective implementation requires proper configuration, maintenance, and updates.
- User awareness and training are still vital to prevent social engineering attacks that bypass technical controls.
