[3D Icons Link](https://3dicons.co/)
*3Dicons is a website that I accidentally stumbled upon while frantically fixing the "general aesthetic" of an arch installation... It is one of the only resources where you can find over 100 icons that have the new age "blurred" "3D" and "Glass" appeal that many of us are currently trying to find within our design layouts... 

[Iqoniq Design Link](https://iqonic.design/)
*Iconiq Design doesn't just stop at icons, they have almost anything you could dream up in the space of web design, HTML, CSS Snippets, project templates, and more...*

[XOX Pixel Link](https://www.xopixel.com)
*XOX Pixel is another great resource for aesthetic design toolkits. They also have extensive tutorials on their website which are very very useful for someone new in the UI design game...
