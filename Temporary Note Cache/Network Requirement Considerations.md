## Network Requirement Considerations Overview 
 1. Number of Devices: Consider the total number of devices that will be connected to the network, including computers, smartphones, IoT devices, and other peripherals.

 2. Bandwidth Needs: Assess the bandwidth requirements of the devices and applications that will be used on the network, such as streaming, gaming, or file transfers.

 3. Security Considerations: Determine the level of security needed for the network, including encryption, firewalls, and access control measures.

 4. Scalability: Anticipate future growth and consider the network's ability to scale to accommodate additional devices and users.

 5. Network Traffic: Analyze the type and volume of network traffic to ensure that the network can handle the expected data transfer and communication needs.

 6. Physical Layout: Take into account the physical layout of the space where the network will be deployed, including the size of the area and any potential obstacles to signal transmission.
